\begin{problem}{10.1a}
Using Eq.\ (10A.21), what is the variance of the combined forecast? What is its covariance with the return? Remember that the combined forecast is simply a linear combination of signals. We know the volatilities and correlations of all the signals, and we know the correlation of each signal with the return.

Verify Eq.\ (10A.23) for the IC of the combined forecast. Demonstrate that when $K = 2$, it reduces to Eq.\ (10.27) in the main test of the chapter. 
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
Eq.\ (10A.21) states that \[\bphi = \omega \cdot \IC_{g}^{T} \cdot \brho_{g}^{-1} \cdot \z.\]
\end{proof}
